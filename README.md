# Xen

Xen is a loosely-typed, imperative scripting language written in C. Its syntax closesly resembles C-like languages and the bytecode compiler and VM is a mere 70Kb in total. Its primary purpose is to serve as a learning project for myself and a fun side project to work on in my free time. **It is not designed with the intent of being a serious, production-ready language.**

If you want to try the current version of Xen for yourself, you can download [precompiled binaries](https://github.com/jakerieger/Xen/releases/latest) or download and compile the source code yourself. You can also checkout [Xen's "Get Started" guide](https://jakerieger.github.io/Xen/get-started.html) for a quick guide on getting up and running with programming in Xen.

## Examples
